The Client, service contractors and exhibitors must comply with all federal, state, and municipal fire codes that apply to a place of public assembly, as well as Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) regulations.

Fire and emergency equipment may not be blocked or obstructed under any circumstance. All fire hose connections, extinguisher cabinets and fire alarm call stations must be visible at all times.

The following are responsible for ensuring all regulations are followed: Client, exhibitor, General Services Contractors. It is a requirement for the AFD to review and approve all event preplans and floor plans.

Chains or locks may not be placed on any facility door.

All curtains, drapes, decorations and decorative or construction materials are to be non-combustible or flame retardant. Documentation affirming non-combustible or flame-retardant properties must be available on site.

Whenever, in the opinion of the AFD, it is essential for public safety in any place of public assembly, the owner, agent, or lessee shall employ one or more qualified persons, as required and approved by the AFD, to be on duty. These individuals shall be subject to the AFDâ€™s orders and shall be in uniform and remain on duty during the times such places are open to the public.

All event floor plans require ACC approval. Your Event Coordinator will submit all floor plans to the Fire Marshal for approval. The Client is cautioned not to sell exhibit space until the Fire Marshal has approved the floor plan in an effort to avoid costly changes involving exhibitions.
Fire hose cabinets, fire pull stations, aisle ways and exits may not be blocked.

Multi-level exhibits and single-level exhibits with an enclosed ceiling, vehicles, boats, and similar exhibited products having over three hundred square feet (400 sq. ft.) of roofed area must be approved in advance (see Multi Level Exhibits).

Any exhibit containing a roofed area of one hundred square feet (100 sq. ft.) or more requires a fire extinguisher to be displayed at such exhibit. Covered exhibits or displays exceeding three hundred square feet (400 sq. ft.) or multi-level displays must meet specific fire regulations (see Covered Exhibits).
