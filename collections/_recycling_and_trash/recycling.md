### The ACC exceeds the City of Austin’s recycling program. 

The ACC recycles paper, cardboard, plastic bottles, glass bottles, cardboard, aluminum, and metal. Material disposal shall be handled as follows:

Corrugated cardboard – a separate baler is dedicated for corrugated cardboard only. Cardboard must be flattened by GSC personnel. If ACC labor is used to flatten materials, the Client will be assessed labor charges at the prevailing rate.

The General Service Contractor personnel must not place any material in the cardboard baler. Only ACC designated staff will place items in the baler and operate it. Large recycle bins will be provided to the General Service Contractor in order to discard all cardboard, recycle or landfill materials. Recycling stations, which include a large bin and a recycle sign, will be placed throughout the exhibit halls during move in and move out hours. ACC staff will discard the contents of the bins and place them back in the exhibit halls. All other contents including, but not limited to, wooden materials, wooden pallets, cement block, padding or hazardous materials should not be placed in the bins.
