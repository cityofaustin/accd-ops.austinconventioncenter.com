title: Trash and Waste Removal
order: 3
---

The Austin Convention Center staff will empty its own trash containers placed throughout both facilities.

Clients are responsible for the removal of bulk trash in the meeting rooms, ballrooms, exhibit halls and pre-function space such as registration areas and show office areas during move-in, show and move-out. Bulk trash is deemed as crates, lumber, pallets, packing materials, and any other excessive trash not easily removed by a standard push broom or vacuum. Clients will assess labor charges at the prevailing rate for the removal of bulk trash.

All Austin Convention Center waste compactors will be locked and only accessible by our staff. Carpet tubes must be cut no longer than two feet (2’) in length to be disposed of in the compost compactor or the cardboard baler.

Clean-up of special effect items will be charged to clients at the prevailing rate.

Carpet removal is the sole responsibility of the General Service Contractor and all carpet should be removed off-site by the end of the last contract date.

An open top dumpster is required for all non-recyclable goods. Your Event Coordinator will be responsible for determining the number of open top dumpsters required based on the size of your event. The General Service Contractor is responsible for scheduling the delivery and removal of open top dumpsters.
