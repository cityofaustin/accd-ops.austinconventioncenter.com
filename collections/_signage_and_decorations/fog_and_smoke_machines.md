title: Fog and Smoke Machines
order: 9

Fog and smoke machines, as well as the schedule for use of such, require advance approval. Any “fogging” or “hazing” has the potential to activate one of the many types of fire detection devices in the facility. Therefore, at least sixty (60) days advance notice given to your Event Coordinator is required to avoid unwanted disruption to an event. Fog and smoke machine usage is restricted to water-based chemicals. Use of fog or smoke machine(s) will require a re-watch. Such costs are at the client’s expense.
