The ACC does not provide decorations (such as plants, etc.) for any event at the facility. The service for such may be arranged through the General Service Contractor or another subcontractor of the Client. Cost to repair damage resulting from the improper or unauthorized installation of materials will be charged to the Client.

All curtains, drapes, decorations and decorative or construction materials must be non-combustible or flame retardant. Documentation affirming non-combustible or flame-retardant properties must be available on site.

Cleanup fees are assessed at the prevailing rate when special effect items are used, such as confetti or balloon drops. Live Christmas trees are not permitted. Construction painting is not permitted on the premises.

Pressure-adhesive stickers or decals or similar promotional items are not allowed for distribution in the facility.

The facility requests that gum is not used as a decoration or give-a-way to attendees while in the facility.

All decorations remaining in the facility at the conclusion of the event are considered trash.
