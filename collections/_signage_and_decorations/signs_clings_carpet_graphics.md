The Austin Convention Center strives to accommodate requests to promote events with interior signs, banners and other forms of promotional advertisement, including exhibitor’s requests for signage above booth areas. The following guidelines are designed to protect the interest of all users of the facility and maintain an appropriate building environment. Generally, these guidelines do not apply to or installations by individual exhibitors within exhibit booths.

- Requests for installation of show banners, exterior, interior or directional signs, window clings and carpet adhesive graphics must be submitted to your Event Coordinator six (6) months in advance.

Damage resulting from the improper and/or unauthorized installation of materials will be charged to clients.
- Third party advertisement banners are not allowed.

- Signs are not allowed to be attached to electrical lighting conduits, utility pipes or sprinkler systems.
- All beam structures or other painted surfaces must be covered with protective material before wire, cable, or the like is attached to prevent damaging the painted surface.
