Austin Convention Center has an “open dock” policy allowing individual exhibitors the right to handle their own freight if desired. Exhibiting firm personnel are allowed to unload, install, and dismantle the exhibits of the exhibit firm.

Event Coordinator assigns dock space(s) for events. The standard is two (2) docks per exhibit hall. The facility does not relinquish control of the loading docks and service yard during any event.
