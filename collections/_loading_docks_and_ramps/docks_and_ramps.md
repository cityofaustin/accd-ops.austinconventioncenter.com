The ACC has an “open dock” policy. This allows individual exhibitors the right to handle their own freight if desired. Exhibiting firm personnel are allowed to unload, install, and dismantle the exhibits of the exhibit firm.

Loading dock bays are allocated according to the event. The facility does not relinquish control of the loading dock during any event.

Your Event Coordinator assigns the dock space(s) for your events. Storage is not allowed on or near the loading dock.
