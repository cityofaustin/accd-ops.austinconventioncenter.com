Registration areas in the pre-function and lobby areas are provided on a complimentary basis. Registration equipment, telecommunication and data equipment and utility services are not included. In the event of multiple events, drape lines are required to cover construction or demolition of registration areas in public space. Access to all public space must be scheduled through your Event Coordinator or Sales Representative. Registration counters may only be set in designated areas. In order to provide safe and attractive access to the facility, registration areas, entrance units and other show specific displays may only be installed in public areas during times when it does not conflict with the activity of other events already in progress.
