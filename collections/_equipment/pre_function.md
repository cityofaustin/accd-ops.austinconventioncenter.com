Pre-function or lobby areas are considered facility common areas and may not be leased for event use. These areas are used to support business operations for Austin Convention Center events, which includes space for pedestrian traffic, registration, ticket sales, and in-house catering operations. Furniture located throughout these areas is not allowed to be moved. All other event activities must be held within the contracted space. Pre-function or lobby areas, side doors, escalators, and passenger elevators are not to be used for move-in or move-out purposes. Detailed floor plans are required and must be approved before use of pre-function or lobby areas.
