Pre-function or lobby areas are considered facility common areas and may not be leased for event use. Pre-function and lobby areas are used to support business operations for ACCD events, and includes space for pedestrian traffic, registration, ticket sales, ACC concession operations or food service connected with facility events and other activities associated with conducting convention center business. All other event activities must be held within the contracted space. Exhibits set in pre-function space, on any level of the facility, must be approved in advance and a fee will be assessed for exhibits in such areas. Detailed floor plans are required and must be approved before use of pre-function or lobby areas. Pre-function or lobby areas, side doors, escalators and passenger elevators are not to be used for move-in or move-out purposes. Access to all pre-function or lobby area space must be scheduled through your Event Coordinator. The Client is responsible for removal of bulk trash in the pre-function space and will be responsible for costs associated with the removal of such excess.
