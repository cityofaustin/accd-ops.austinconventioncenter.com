Clients and the General Service Contractor are responsible for the transport of crates and boxes to and from the licensed premises. Austin Convention Center personnel are not allowed to move freight, including, but not limited to, crates, boxes and pallets for the client or any exhibitor.

- Equipment and freight must be loaded and unloaded in the dock area.
- Doorways, carpeted areas, and floors must be protected from the movement of crates, registration counters, pallet jacks and sign-hanging activities.
- When off loading counters, booths, and other heavy objects, the use of floor protection and extreme care are required. Carpeted areas must be protected by the use of a minimum of six millimeter (6mm) polyethylene sheeting (reinforced preferred). Temporary carpet or plywood on top of reinforced polyethylene sheeting must be used for heavy objects.
- Heavy objects are defined as items in excess of 1,500 pounds or that exceed the limit of an average pallet jack.
- Motorized vehicles, forklifts, gas or electric carts, bicycles, scooters or similar equipment (except equipment for persons who are mobility impaired) may not be operated on any permanent carpeted areas in the facility.
- Dollies are not available for clients or exhibitors.
