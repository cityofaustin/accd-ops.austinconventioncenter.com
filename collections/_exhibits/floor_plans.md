A preliminary exhibit floor plan is required prior to booth sales or minimum of one (1) year prior to the first contract day. Exhibit floor plans must first be sent to your Event Coordinator or Sales Representative for review. Your Event Coordinator may submit the floor plan to the AFD Fire Marshal for approval. Clients are cautioned not to sell exhibit space until the facility has approved the floor plan. This step is to ensure that exits, aisles and fire protection equipment are clear and unobstructed, as well as, to avoid costly changes involving exhibits. Final approval is given after an on-site inspection by Austin Convention Center Safety Officer or AFD Fire Marshal.

Changes in plans may be required to achieve the safety and the order of facility operations, contract compliance, and policies and procedures of Austin Convention Center. Coordination for use of the pre-function/lobby areas of the facility by joint users will be handled by your Event Coordinator. Any exceptions to the following requirements must be submitted to your Event Coordinator.
