A preliminary exhibit floor plan is required one (1) year prior to the first contract day. Exhibit floor plans must first be sent to your Event Coordinator or Sales Representative for review, who then submits the plan to the AFD Fire Marshal for approval. The ACC and the Fire Marshal approve all floor plans prior to move-in. Floor plans are not considered approved without being signed and stamped “Approved” from the ACC and the AFD Fire Marshal. An approved copy of the floor plan will be returned to the Client and General Service Contractor. The Client is cautioned not to sell exhibit space until the AFD Fire Marshal has approved the floor plan. This is to ensure that exits, aisles and fire protection equipment are clear and unobstructed, as well as, to avoid costly changes involving exhibits. Final approval is given after an on-site inspection by the AFD Fire Marshal is conducted.

Changes in proposed plans may be required to achieve the safe and orderly operation of the facility, compliance with the contract and ACC policies and procedures and coordination of use of the pre-function/lobby areas of the facility by joint users.
The Client must allow a ten foot by ten-foot (10’ x 10’) area for the ACC utility service booth.
