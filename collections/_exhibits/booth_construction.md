Exhibit booths shall be constructed of noncombustible or limited combustible materials. Wood shall be greater than one-quarter inch (1/4”) nominal thickness or wood not greater than one-quarter inch (1/4”) thickness shall be treated with a fire retardant meeting the requirements of National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standard 703. Other combustible materials must be flame resistant in accordance with NFPA 701 for textiles and films, and Underwriters Laboratories (U.L.) 1975 for foamed plastics. Cotton batting, straw, dry vines or leaves, celluloid or other flammable material is not allowed unless it is fireproofed in a manner approved by the Fire Marshal. Proof of treatment, if applied by the exhibitor, must be provided and displayed on-site. Fireproofing and approval are required in advance.

Vehicle cleaning using wax or Armor-all creates a very hazardous and slippery condition. Applications must be done with a pre-soaked cloth. Spray cans or bottles are not permitted. All hard floor surfaces must be totally covered with a nonporous covering during application of waxes or Armor-all products.
