If the Client is paying for attendee event parking, contact your Event Coordinator for options and information. 

The service yard is for service vehicles and scheduled event-related or Austin Convention Center Department loading/unloading. Parking is not allowed in the service yard area.

Event Parking is not allowed in the ACC Circle Drive located on Cesar Chavez Street. Unless otherwise approved by the Department Director, this parking area is strictly for use for use by persons conducting business at the ACC Administrative Offices, 500 E. Cesar Chavez, or for emergency services use only.

Mobility Impaired Parking is available around the ACC and in the parking garages. Eighteen (18) spaces are designated within the ACC parking garages. Vehicles displaying a valid State of Texas approved handicap license plate or placard are allowed to park at any City of Austin parking meter at no charge.

Shuttle bus cutouts are located along Trinity Street from Cesar Chavez to 4th Street. Please notify your Event Coordinator or Sales Representative if you will have shuttle buses for your event and they will assist you with planning details. Vehicles and buses may not be left unattended in the cutouts as they are considered as a portion of a city street and are subject to ticketing by the Austin Police Department, other City of Austin Parking Enforcement staff or ACCD Facility Security staff.

During events, an Event Security Staff member or LPO may be required to control access to circle drive, bus cutouts and driveways to maintain facility access.
