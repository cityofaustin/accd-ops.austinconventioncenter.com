The ACC provides custodial service for all public areas, restrooms, meeting rooms, and ballrooms (except when used for exhibits) at no cost to the Client. Booth cleaning and aisle vacuuming in any exhibit area is the responsibility of the Client or General Service Contractor. ACC personnel will clean non-carpeted food service areas on show days only. The ACC will empty its trash containers placed in the aisles during show and non-show hours.

The Client is responsible for the removal of bulk trash in the meeting rooms, ballrooms, exhibit halls and pre-function areas such as registration and show office areas during move-in, show and move-out. Bulk trash is defined as boxes, crates, lumber, pallets, packing materials, and any other excessive trash not easily removed by a standard push broom or vacuum.

The Client is responsible for removing all tape from the exhibit hall floor or carpeted areas at the end of the event.

Clean-up of special effect items, such as confetti, balloon drops, etc., will be charged to the Client at the prevailing rate. The Client will also be responsible for costs associated with excessive clean-up.
