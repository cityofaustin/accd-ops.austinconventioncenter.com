ACC can staff a Coat & Baggage Check if needed â€“ contact your Event Coordinator to schedule. Events may also handle coat and baggage checks themselves, but ACC is not responsible for any lost or stolen articles at locations that are not handled by ACC staff. Coat and baggage check can be set up at client request areas with preference being a secure, enclosed area such as a contracted meeting room.
