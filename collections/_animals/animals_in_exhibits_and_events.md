- Submit a written request to display animals to your Event Coordinator.
- USDA certification may be required for certain animals.
- Animals are not permitted to stay in the facility overnight.
- Supervise animals at all times.
- Provide curbing, fencing, or alternate materials to contain animals.
- Place a protective coating such as plastic to protect our floors and equipment.
- Place some type of fire retardant absorbent within the pens.
- Clean-up rented space and properly dispose absorbents and waste.
