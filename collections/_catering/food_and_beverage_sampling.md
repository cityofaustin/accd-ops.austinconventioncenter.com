**Things to know and resources for Temporary Food Service Permit to Operate:**

The City of Austin and Travis County Health Department requires the show management to submit an application for a Temporary Food Service - Permit to Operate for every booth that is sampling. The individual exhibiting companies may not apply for the permits themselves. Clients will need to collect the information from the sampling exhibitors and submit for the permit on behalf of the exhibiting companies. Additionally, clients must physically go to the Health Department offices and pay for and/or pick up the permits. Permits must be given to the exhibiting companies’ onsite so they may be displayed at their booth.

At any time the policies, requirements, and application process may be changed without notice, per the City of Austin and Travis County Health Department. Clients are responsible to communicate and confirm the approval and execution of all Temporary Permits within their contracted space.
