Equipment is maintained to accommodate simultaneous events and is assigned on a first-come first-served basis. In the event that additional equipment needs to be rented to accommodate service: i.e. additional glassware, china, table linens, tables, tents, reefer trucks or portable kitchens, the client will be billed for rental of equipment and labor to set the equipment needed to meet event requirements.

Plated Meal Services may require additional space within exhibit halls when accommodating groups larger than 1000 guests. Please speak with your Catering Manager for more details.
