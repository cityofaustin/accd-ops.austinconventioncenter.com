Concessions, alcoholic beverages, and catering services are exclusive to the in-house food and beverage management company (ACC Catering) Arrangements for catering services must be made through your assigned Catering Manager.

The ACC has the right to open and maintain concession stands for any event at the facility. The ACC has exclusive contracts with certain food and beverage providers.

Portable concessions and bars may be located in other areas of the facility. Portable concession and bar areas require power; therefore, specific placement is recommended in the following areas. Please coordinate this placement directly with your Catering Manager.

ACC requires a thirty-by-thirty-foot (30’ x 30’) concession area to service five hundred (500) attendees if no other food options are available; a thirty -foot by sixty- foot (30’x 60’) area is required to service one thousand plus (1000+) attendees. This space is for the equipment only; additional space is needed for seating.

Exhibit floor plans must indicate the thirty-by-thirty-foot (30’ x 30’) areas for concession equipment in each hall. Additional space is required to accommodate seating.

Portable concession stands require access to four (4) floor pockets for power requirements or may require a location near a 208-volt power source.

ACC permanent concession locations may not be blocked at any time.
