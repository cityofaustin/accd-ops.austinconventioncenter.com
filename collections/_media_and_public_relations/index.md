The ACC welcomes the media to events held at the facility. Press releases are sent out for specific ACC activity, but not specific for each event. The Client will be assessed the overtime rate for media access to the facility prior to 6:00am. For safety reasons, the routing of support cables for media must be coordinated through your Event Coordinator. Media support vehicles are not allowed to park on public sidewalks, block entrance/exit doors or route shore power to their vehicles from inside the facility.
