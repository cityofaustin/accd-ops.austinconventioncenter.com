Minimal levels of lighting are maintained during move-in and move-out. Facility rental includes lighting in public areas, meeting rooms and ballrooms (except when used for exhibits) during move-in, show and move-out. During low traffic move-in and move-out times, minimal lighting is provided at no charge. Work lighting will be provided during heavier traffic move-in and move-out times at no charge as determined by your Event Coordinator.

The lighting pods in the exhibit halls consist of four different levels: minimal, work lights (2 tubes per fixture), show lights (4 tubes per fixture) and premium lights (6 tubes per fixture).

Show lighting is provided in the exhibit halls thirty (30) minutes prior to the show opening on the first day and fifteen (15) minutes prior to the show opening on subsequent days. Premium lighting is available at the prevailing rates in effect at the time.

The meeting rooms and ballrooms have lighting controls in each room. Special lighting levels may be pre-set, when requested.

Requests to dim lights in the pre-function and lobby areas for an event must be reviewed in advance. Impact on other events in the facility and safety are considered before approval is given.

Fluorescent lighting in the facility is not dimmable.

The ballrooms and exhibit halls have metal halide lights.

The Client is responsible for the costs associated with requests to remove light bulbs to gain a specific lighting effect within the exhibit halls.

The directional lighting grid in Ballrooms D-G is east to west and the directional lighting grid in Ballrooms A-C is north to south.
