All Event requests to possess, show or display any firearms, ammunition, simulated firearms, simulated ammunition, or dangerous weapons on ACC premises must be made in writing to the ACC ninety (90) days prior to the first contracted date. The request must include the following information:

- a. Person making the request, including contact information.
- b. Any organization, public or private, represented.
- c. Type and number of firearms, ammunition, or weapons to be displayed.
- d. Purpose or intent of the possession, show or display.
- e. Any additional background requested by the ACC Security and Safety Division.
- f. Any supporting material for consideration.

The ACC Chief of Security and Safety will ensure each request is reviewed and approved by the ACC Director as deemed appropriate.
If approved, the requestor will be notified of such, and a pre-event meeting may be scheduled with the ACC Security and Safety Divisionâ€™s Health and Safety Specialist.

Events anticipated to attract a large number of costumed attendees may be required to have a dedicated check-in area for those bringing simulated firearms or demonstration/simulated weapons. Staffing charges may apply in these cases.
