### Armed Security - Texas Licensed Police Officers (LPOs)

Austin Convention Center has the exclusive right to hire Texas Licensed Peace Officers (LPOs), train, and equip them with the necessary information to provide continuous public safety for the facilities, clients, and attendees. LPOs may be required for traffic management at both facilities to include and not limited to service yards, circle drives, parking facilities, and private drives. LPOs are also exclusive to VIP escorts, Executive Protection Teams, cosplay weapons checks, and other scenarios where police officers are needed. A four (4) hour minimum is required for their services. Please contact your assigned Security Coordinator to schedule LPOs. [Hyperlink to “Security and Safety Rate Sheet”]

### Emergency Medical Technician(s)

At the Austin Convention Center, the safety and well-being of guests is very important. Therefore, we ask clients to prepare for potential medical emergencies. Depending on the size and type of event, emergency medical technician(s) (EMTs) may be suitable and/or required to be on-site during move-in/move-out or during show hours. EMTs are scheduled for hire through your assigned Security Coordinator based on the prevailing rate.
