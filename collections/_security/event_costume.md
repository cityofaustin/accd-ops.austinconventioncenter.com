Costumes are allowed on the property of ACCD facilities as part of a scheduled event or in support of the operations of the Department. The ACCD Director or designee, using reasonable discretion, will make the final determination on the appropriateness of costumes allowed at ACCD facilities. Metal detectors and “weapons holding areas” may be required for events with heavy costume usage.
- a. No costume may be worn that in its manner or design displays nudity that would be deemed illegal or offensive.
- b. No costume that resembles or imitates law enforcement, military personnel or any other government public safety entity will include a mask that covers the individual’s face.
- c. A person who has as a part of their costume a weapon or any other instrument that requires a safety check inspection will remove any facial cover or headgear for the duration of that inspection.
- d. Any person who has as a part of their costume a facial cover or headgear that obscures their face may be asked by ACCD security staff to remove the cover.

Failure to comply with the guidelines set out above my result in removal of the person from ACCD property.
