The ACC is equipped with closed circuit television cameras mounted in various locations inside and outside. The security personnel monitor these cameras from the Security Operations Center.

The ACCD employs the Incident Command model for management of significant emergency incidents. An Incident Commander (IC) is designated to oversee, manage and make decisions in regards to an emergency situation.

The IC is subject to change during the course of an emergency. Your Event Coordinator will keep the Client and service contractors informed in emergency situations and of decisions relating to events.
