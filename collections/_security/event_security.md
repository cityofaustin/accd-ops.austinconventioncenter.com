Event security is an exclusive service provided at the Austin Convention Center.

Clients are responsible for security and safety personnel as required to secure leased premises, public areas used for display, registration, and possibly the parking garage during the full time of their contracted dates and times. Austin Convention Center Security Coordinator will determine the event security staffing levels for each day of your event. A four (4) hour minimum is required for all event security staffing shifts.

A minimum level of event security and Licensed Peace Officer (LPO) staffing is required during move-in, show hours, and move-out. Special events, such as, but not limited to: concerts, galas, dances, and sporting events will require a more detailed event security staffing plan. The event security staffing plan will be coordinated by the assigned Security Coordinator.

In all cases, event security staffing must have enough personnel to execute the emergency plans developed by the Facilities Security and Safety Division for your show. Relief security staff are required to ensure complete coverage and to ensure other event security guards are given time for breaks and meals.
                    
Abusive language, disruptive music, threats, assault, vandalism, theft, and other conduct detrimental to the successful staging of an event are grounds for immediate removal from the premises or arrest, depending on the nature of the offense. Solicitation is prohibited.

### Event Costume Policy 

Costumes are allowed on the property of Austin Convention Center as part of a scheduled event or in support of facility operations. Using reasonable discretion, the director will make the final determination on the appropriateness of costumes allowed.

No costume may be worn in its manner or design displays nudity that would be deemed illegal or offensive.
No costume that resembles or imitates law enforcement, military personnel, or any other government public safety entity will include a mask that covers the individual’s face.

### Prop Costume Weapons

All prop costume weapons will be inspected upon entry to the facility. Cosplay weapons checks will be performed by department staff and a Licensed Police Officer. For multi-day events, cosplay prop costume weapons should be inspected each show day.

- All attendees wearing costumes with headgear that obscures their face may be asked by event security staff to remove their mask during the cosplay weapons check process.

### Weapons Sales

Exhibitors and vendors who sell weapons at their booths, within the event expo, should establish a “Sell and Pick-up Plan” for the sold weapon or item. Exhibitors and vendors should complete the sale of the weapon, re-box the item(s), and tape it sealed shut. The “Sell and Pick-up Plan” initiative is to provide the sold item to the buyer at the end of the show day when the expo closes, or when the buyer agrees to depart the facility for the day. Steel swords/sabers, hatchets, air guns, arrows/quivers, knives, and throwing stars sold on the expo floor are considered real weapons.

Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in removal of the attendee or exhibitor from the Austin Convention Center.

### Liquid, Gas, and Electric Fueled Vehicles/Boats/RV’s and Equipment for Display

In accordance with 2015 International Fire Code Section 314.4, all vehicles, boats, RV’s, and equipment which generate power by the use of a liquid, gas, or electricity must be inspected prior to entering the facility.
