title: Rigging and Hanging Points
order: 1
---

We provide a [rigging guide](https://assets.austinconventioncenter.com/2023/accd-rigging-guide-feb-23.pdf) to be used as a tool by qualified and competent persons, but is not to supersede federal, state and local industry standards or manufacturers recommendations. All banners, rigging, sign hanging and aerial lift work must be done by trained personnel (as defined by OHSA) competent and qualified as determined by need and capability. 

We do not provide and/or rent aerial lifts. All aerial lifts must be sourced by contractors.

Equipment: 
- Must meet ASME, ANSI, Federal, manufacturer and industry standards for hardware, lifts and motors.
- Capable for an assigned task.
- Inspected prior and after each use (this includes equipment belonging to the venue). If venue equipment fails inspection, it is to be reported to City of Austin personnel and not to be put in service until repairs are completed.
- Contractors are responsible for any work performed.

Submit requests for installation of show banners, exterior signs, interior signs, directional signs and rigging to your Event Coordinator thirty-one (31) days before the first contract day. A plan must be submitted indicating all points and the weight for each. An electronic version of facility space may be requested from your Event Coordinator or Sales Representative to assist you with the planning process. For more information, please refer to the [Rigging Guide](https://assets.austinconventioncenter.com/2023/accd-rigging-guide-feb-23.pdf).
