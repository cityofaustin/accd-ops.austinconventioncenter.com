Freight – We do not accept, store, or ship freight or packages for exhibitors, attendees, or clients before, during or after an event. Freight is to be handled by the General Service Contractor or delivered directly to clients during the leased period specified on the contract. We decline receipt of any shipments arriving prior to the first contract day. Austin Convention Center employees are not permitted to sign for shipments at any time. All freight must be shipped to the General Service Contractor or drayage company before the event. All materials, equipment and/or freight are to be delivered and removed through the service yard entrance.  All materials, equipment, and/or freight must be stored on trailers or must be taken off-site during show dates. Freight staging prior to move-out will be done on a case-by-case basis and the request must be submitted with a diagram showcasing/displaying desired locations. We are not responsible for any loss or damage to property of any kind shipped or delivered to the facility.
